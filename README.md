Blockchain, the technology underpinning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, for years has been viewed by some companies as a way to drive industry-transforming projects, among them the tracking of assets through complex supply chains.

So far, that hasn’t happened.

The latest effort to run aground was that of A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and International Business Machines Corp., which hoped to follow shipments via the blockchain. Last month, Maersk said the project would be discontinued. Another big effort, Walmart Inc.’s attempt to track groceries on the blockchain, continues, but slowly.

It has been slow going or worse for big bets on blockchain for a number of reasons: the complexity of the technology, the time required to get a blockchain into operation and the difficulties in enlisting participants.

Analysts say they rarely hear about Walmart’s greens-tracking work anymore. IBM is also mentioning enterprise blockchain less frequently in its corporate filings, said Julie Bhusal Sharma, an equity analyst at Morningstar Inc. who follows the company.
